## 🎨 What is Quantum Canvas?

Quantum Canvas is an interactive web application that generates unique abstract artwork using simulated quantum computing principles. Each piece is created by simulating quantum states, superposition, and wave function collapse to produce truly one-of-a-kind art.

## ✨ Features

- **8 Artistic Styles** — Abstract, Dalí, Picasso, Kandinsky, Pollock, Mondrian, Van Gogh, Escher
- **8 Color Palettes** — Cosmic, Aurora, Nebula, Inferno, Ocean, Monochrome, Psychedelic, Ethereal
- **4 Symmetry Modes** — None, Bilateral, Radial, Kaleidoscope
- **Quantum Parameters** — Adjust qubits, complexity, entropy, harmonics, and layer depth
- **Download Your Art** — Save your creations as PNG files
- **IBM Quantum Integration** — Real quantum hardware support (coming soon)

## 🖼️ How It Works

1. **Quantum State Simulation** — The app simulates quantum states using superposition principles
2. **Wave Function Collapse** — Each measurement collapses the wave function, creating unique probability distributions
3. **Artistic Rendering** — These quantum probabilities drive the artistic generation, ensuring every piece is unique
